DigitalLibrary
==============

A digital library that includes metadata inheritance from parent folder(s).
Built using a [Zope](http://zope2.zope.org/ "Zope 2") web framework.
See https://eng.ucmerced.edu/snsjho for a working implementation of this software; active since March 2007.
I stopped participating in the development of **DigitalLibrary** during 2008; the source code in this repository is a snapshot of the code before leaving the project.
